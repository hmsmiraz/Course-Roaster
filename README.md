# Answer


- Add at least 3 Project features:
  1. Added card for every course and cart also,
  2. Showing the warn toast, if we want to add duplicate course,
  3. Showing the error toast, if we want to take more than 20 credit hours of course,
  4. Responsive for all devices.

- Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project:

  In this assignment, I use state for store the course data for showing and update in card and cart. I use total five UseState hooks. It allows you to declare state variables and update them, triggering re-renders when the state changes.
